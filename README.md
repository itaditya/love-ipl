# Love IPL client

## Libs Used
1. Vue.js - good for quickly making JavaScript rich UI.
2. Vuetify- ready-made material components for Vue enabled me to focus on the logic rather than design.
3. Vuetrend- to add charts

## Completed Bonus Tasks

* [x] created the web-app in Vue.js.
* [x] optimized the loading time. (by using caching, google page speed score 97 on desktop and 89 on mobile).
* [x] made it mobile responsive. (with helpers from vuetify)
* [x] made it a progressive web-app. (Vue provides pwa plugin which internally uses Worbox)
* [x] made it offline usable. (cached important resources and APIs)
